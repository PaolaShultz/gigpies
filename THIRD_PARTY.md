# Source, artwork and media

The Rust foundation, code-authored SVG system diagram and archived SVG banners
are original project work under MIT, including the 0.2.3 dual-console revision.
Their depicted console screens/controllers are schematic original
artwork, not manufacturer screenshots. The original v0.1.0 foundation copied no
sibling code; later DSP adaptations are attributed below. Dependency versions are locked in Cargo.lock;
upstream dependency licences continue to apply.

- hound: Apache-2.0 WAV library.
- serde and serde_json: MIT OR Apache-2.0 serialization libraries.
- rtrb 0.4.0: MIT OR Apache-2.0 bounded single-producer/single-consumer queues.
- socket2 0.6.5: MIT OR Apache-2.0 socket configuration.
- Transitive dependencies: see each package's licence metadata in the locked graph.

`docs/assets/gigpies-concept.png` is AI-generated concept artwork supplied by the
project owner. It is preserved as a concept reference, with limitations documented in
`docs/archive/studies/CONCEPT_REVIEW.md`. Third-party names and marks belong to their owners; no
endorsement or ownership of those marks is claimed.

`docs/assets/gigpies-hero.png` is the replacement photorealistic hero generated
with the built-in image generation tool on 2026-10-04. It uses the owner-supplied
concept and the projects' original offline Desk/Lightdesk screen drafts as visual
references. It depicts an intended setup, not a photographed hardware test.
The exact prompt is `docs/assets/gigpies-hero-prompt.txt`; limitations are in the
[visual review](docs/archive/studies/CONCEPT_REVIEW.md). Rendered manufacturer names and device
designs imply no endorsement or verified model/mapping. No manufacturer photograph
or manual was downloaded or bundled for this revision.

The Complainiacs / Dark Ride recordings are local educational experiment material.
Their source notices remain with local files. They are not covered by this project's

## Offline automixer adaptations

`src/automix/dsp.rs` adapts normalized transposed-direct-form biquads, HPF/bell
coefficient equations and soft-knee compression from:

- [SHR PA](https://github.com/PaolaShultz/shr-pa), `src/dsp.rs`, inspected commit
  `ccc816a97f1957549a2a515d94a672dc78c59012`.
  [Preserved MIT licence](licenses/shr-pa-MIT.txt).
- [SHR DAW](https://github.com/PaolaShultz/shr-daw), `src/effects/compressor.rs`,
  `eq.rs`, `channel.rs`, inspected commit `c3d2e6517cc60c7a75a319655246a54130437875`.
  Stereo maximum detection and attack/release smoothing inform our linked compressor.
  [Preserved MIT licence](licenses/shr-daw-MIT.txt).

SHR DAW gate/mixing and SHR PA metering/offline rendering were reviewed as references.
SHR FX `src/dsp.rs` at `9b9a2a94f8fe79389fba03d065924c0dd335599f` was inspected
for effects/send-return structure during the first pass.
The subsequent effects pass adapts its `src/dsp.rs` Ring/Tap/allpass/comb reverb and
chorus implementations into `src/automix/fx_engines.rs`, and its four-times-oversampled
`src/exciter.rs` into `src/automix/exciter.rs`, including harmonic/alias tests. Static
configuration and local type paths replace host controls; unused reset paths are omitted.
[Preserved SHR FX MIT licence](licenses/shr-fx-MIT.txt).
The new delay, routing, wet-return calibration and deterministic spectral review are
GigPies implementations; no sibling checkout is changed or linked.
The gain estimator, routing, file workflow and preset choices are GigPies work.
Manufacturer guidance and the loudness standard are linked in [AUTOMIX](docs/guides/AUTOMIX.md).

## Offline true-peak measurement

The windowed-sinc estimator in `src/automix/true_peak.rs` is original GigPies code,
following the oversampling guidance of ITU-R BS.1770-5 Annex 2. It does not copy
the standard's example FIR table or add a library dependency. The independently
invoked FFmpeg/libsoxr and SciPy verification tools retain their upstream licences
and are not vendored or downloaded by CI. See [method and references](docs/guides/SUMMING_DELIVERY.md).

The shelf coefficient equations follow Robert Bristow-Johnson's mathematical
[Audio EQ Cookbook, published by W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/audio-eq-cookbook/).
Our implementation fixes shelf slope to S=1. No manufacturer DSP code, firmware,
manual or preset collection is included. See [reference-use boundaries](docs/archive/studies/PRESET_EXPERIMENT.md).

## Brain asynchronous sample-rate conversion

Rubato5.0.1, copyright HEnquist and contributors, is used under its
MIT OR Apache-2.0 licence. The published crate and committed Cargo.lock pin the
implementation. Its asynchronous sinc path supplies preallocated variable-ratio
conversion; no owner PA/FX/REC algorithms are copied.
