# Atomic controller producer fixtures

These integer-only JSON fixtures are generated through the real authenticated
HostAuthority/LocalAudio path using synthetic 16/32/48-input topologies. No PCM
device, network trial or external owner library is activated. Paired replies
contain the existing raw and Brain schemas once each. Successful maintenance
replies retain their original outcome on exact retry.

Regenerate explicitly from the repository root:

```sh
flock -n /home/shome/p/.gigpies-build.lock env \
  CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 GIGPIES_UPDATE_ATOMIC_FIXTURES=1 \
  cargo +1.97.1 test --locked -j1 --features hardware-host --lib atomic
```

Without the update environment variable, normal tests compare the corpus and do
not write it. Focused codec/engine tests:

```sh
flock -n /home/shome/p/.gigpies-build.lock env \
  CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 \
  cargo +1.97.1 test --locked -j1 --test atomic_control
```

The corpus includes exact requests, paired snapshots, maintenance successes,
identity/scope/lease/permission/clock/duplicate refusals, a cached busy refusal,
and committed old/new views across an actual staged Brain change. The tests also
cover all three staged-authority classes, eviction/highwater, overflow, permission
revocation/reconnect, independent nonce admission and active heartbeat churn.
Unsupported versions and malformed inputs fail at the outer decoding boundary;
there is no fabricated successful fallback fixture.

The scope-complete extension adds `scope-*-request`, `scope-*-maintained`,
`scope-*-mismatch` and `scope-*-permission` files from
`atomic_maintenance_every_existing_scope_admitted_by_live_lease` and
`atomic_all_scope_permissions_contexts_revocation_and_replaced_leases` in
`src/remote/atomic_control_tests.rs`. Each uses actual HostAuthority dispatch,
current scope-specific permission, and an explicit C-AUDIO grant against the
16-input/five-monitor software topology. Named monitors 1/2 and dynamic monitors
3/5 are examples, not a product cap. No mock successful reply is substituted.

`scope-noncanonical-monitor-{0,1,2}.json` records explicit producer `scope`
refusals for noncanonical object forms. These are negative inputs, not valid
consumer authority contexts; a strict consumer may reject their context codec.
Unknown names, unit-variant object aliases, extra keys and out-of-u16 values
instead fail at the outer decoder and have no fabricated maintenance reply.
Out-of-topology grants (6 and u16::MAX in this fixture) are separately rejected.

`maintain-scope.json` previously requested FOH against a talkback lease when FOH
maintenance was unsupported. It now requests the configured dynamic monitor 3
against that same talkback lease, preserving a real scope-mismatch refusal after
admission expansion. All other pre-extension fixture bytes, including existing
valid Brain requests/successes and paired snapshots, remain unchanged.

`SHA256SUMS` pins all JSON bytes from these production paths. After explicit
regeneration, refresh and verify it from the repository root:

```sh
sha256sum tests/fixtures/atomic-control-v1/*.json > tests/fixtures/atomic-control-v1/SHA256SUMS
sha256sum --check tests/fixtures/atomic-control-v1/SHA256SUMS
```

Consumer reconciliation must copy the complete corpus and verify this manifest;
provisional client fixtures cannot replace these producer bytes. These fixtures
establish offline protocol behavior only, not network or physical acceptance.
