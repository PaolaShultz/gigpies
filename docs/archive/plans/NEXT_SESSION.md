# Next session: separate physical Brain audio qualification

Recover [status](../../STATUS.md), [Brain audio acceptance](../../acceptance/BRAIN_AUDIO_ACCEPTANCE.md)
and the current private task0015 checkpoint before acting. The production software
passed independent review, complete owner/consumer gates and seven same-candidate
two-Pi scenarios: 16/32/48-input coexistence, duplex stall/restart, controller stall
and Stagebox restart. Earlier failed trials remain evidence, not current acceptance.
The historical execution prompts and consumed reservation slots are not reusable
launch authority. Source synchronization is not deployment.

Brain owns one local duplex endpoint with a separate device clock; two bounded
ASRC crossings connect talkback and operator playback to Stagebox. Stagebox keeps
DSP, PA, raw REC and FX/analysis on its source timeline. See the acceptance record
for exact software scope and remaining physical limits. Unchanged historical
research/audition cases need not be rerun after documentation-only work.

The next physical increment requires a separate authorized session: read-only card
and socket inventory first, then deliberate duplex activation at conservative
levels, channel/direct-monitor mapping, independent-clock and sustained-deadline
measurements, release/failure behavior, and acoustic/output-path qualification.
Do not infer physical clock lock or safe feedback behavior from fake PCM.
The prior handoff is [archived](../brain-audio-before-2026-10-05/NEXT_SESSION.md).

Read the [local integration instructions](../../guides/HEADLESS_INTEGRATION.md),
[implementation map](MODULE_IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md), [Brain plan](../../architecture/BRAIN_CONSOLES.md),
[architecture](../../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [ownership map](../../architecture/COMPONENTS.md). The intended
Brain hosts two 1920×1080 monitors and two independently assigned MIDI controllers:
Desk for audio and Lightdesk for lighting. Manual operation remains independent;
ASSIST proposes, and AUTO requires explicit bounded authority.

| Owner | Accepted software foundation | Next separate increment |
|---|---|---|
| GigPies | Configurable source engine, four-band strip processing, actual PA v2/FX/REC and authenticated QUIC at16/32/48 | Separately authorized physical mapping, drift, deadline and acoustic gates |
| SHR Desk | Native frontend, dynamic high-channel processing and reviewed PA/output configuration | Physical duplex/device, dual-display/controller/LED acceptance remains separate |
| SHR Lightdesk | LD-01..04 including native software frontend and read-only LX05 compatibility | Physical role/display/controller acceptance; later analysis controls only as an explicit increment |
| SHR Lux | LX-01..05 null-output authority, release/recovery and named source automation | LX-06 fixture output only with known patch, explicit arming and hardware reservation |
| SHR REC / FX / PA | Actual raw REC, source-clock FX and configurable PA v2 consumed by the modular graph | Owner algorithm extensions and acoustic acceptance; no duplicate algorithms in GigPies |

Read each owner's instructions and current acceptance before changes. Console
software rendering and injected descriptors do not verify actual display/controller
identity, MIDI or LED ownership. Real enumeration and dual-device acceptance remain
GP-H2. Missing or ambiguous identities must remain unbound.

Physical fixture output, acoustic protection and combined CPU/GPU/memory/scheduler
acceptance require their own authorized sessions and reservations. Preserve human
holds and current looks through loss/reconnect until explicit release. Lighting
failure must not block audio control or recording. No physical operation follows
from the completed software publication.

## Qualified stereo hardware handoff

Read [AUDIO_HARDWARE.md](../../acceptance/AUDIO_HARDWARE.md) and [its owning plan](AUDIO_HARDWARE_PLAN.md).
The selected USB host uses 48-frame / 1 ms processing, independent device capacity
and zero silent prefill, with real PA/FX/REC modules and sample-verified recovery.
The final ten-minute working-channel H8 run measured **5.19–5.23 ms**, with exact
software output and zero xruns/late wet returns. Two one-frame physical offset
changes remain unresolved. The historical 56 ms prefill/57 ms loopback is not the
current live-latency result.

The next useful physical check is a narrowly scoped USB transfer/feedback trace
around those changes under a fresh reservation. Existing one-second driver
snapshots are too coarse to identify the cause. Keep direct audio buffers fixed.
Read final H7/H8 conditions, retained xruns and the locked-page migration diagnosis
before extending the tested scope. Temporary settings were restored; no persistent
low-latency host profile was installed.

The prior session authorized the working channel. That does not grant a new
hardware session. The right return was about 69 dB weaker; verify a working route
before stereo physical acceptance. The USB microphone was absent. Acoustic PA,
clock, multichannel mixer, UI and complete-show acceptance remain separate.

## Offline listening handoff

The [summing plan](SUMMING_PLAN.md) and [delivery contract](../../guides/SUMMING_DELIVERY.md)
are implemented and offline-validated, now included in 0.2.3. The f64 summer,
channel choices and selected GigPies effects remain unchanged; no supported new
musical candidate was selected.

Use the retained private listening index
`artifacts/automix/summing-study/2026-10-03-engine/LISTEN.md`. It identifies six
complete mixes, seven established excerpts and exact historical comparisons.
Independent measurements range from −1.400441 to −1.395178 dBTP against the −1 dBTP
ceiling; the largest production/independent difference is 0.004922 dB. Deliveries
use static gain on the selected buses, with 0.4001 dB margin and no loudness target.

Obtain a fresh playback go, then record preference by passage and concern. Do not
rerender just to reopen this queue, or repeat historical planners without a new
hypothesis and stopping rules. Preserve source recordings, frozen settings, hashes
and useful evidence. Latest publication checks live in [VALIDATION.md](../records/VALIDATION.md).
The unresolved earlier Pi crash still needs separate diagnosis; boot recovery and
zero current filesystem counters do not establish a complete offline scan.

## Peer work and resource ownership

Read `/home/shome/p/AGENTS.md` and [NODE_LAB.md](../../development/NODE_LAB.md). Check the actual
hostname and live working trees; development coordinator/worker roles do not fix
the runtime Stagebox/Brain Pi assignment. The private ledger owns reservations,
exact source revisions and immutable review/acceptance records.

Use bounded `gigpies-peer` workers only within the current authorized scope; never
resume or take over an existing interactive session. Keep one owner per file and
resource. Shared load, hardware and restart experiments require a new explicit
reservation. Completed synthetic transport and stereo integration are recorded in
[transport](AUDIO_TRANSPORT_PLAN.md) and [hardware](AUDIO_HARDWARE_PLAN.md); do not
repeat them merely because an old execution prompt says to start them.
