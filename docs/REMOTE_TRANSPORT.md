# Authenticated remote commands and media

The `remote` module carries actual GigPies authority requests and GPA1 audio over
mutually authenticated QUIC connections. Quinn and rustls require TLS 1.3,
explicit CA trust and a separately provisioned SHA256 leaf-certificate permission
record. Early data and TLS session resumption are disabled. Bind addresses must be
explicit private or loopback addresses. Credentials, peer policies and synthetic
run reports belong outside Git.

`RemoteServer` authenticates the peer before constructing `AuthenticatedContext`.
Its permissions limit which existing authority scopes the peer may acquire; they
are not themselves write grants. Mutations use the session-derived writer and a
live engine lease. C-AUDIO readback is required before writes, and processing and
structural writes require their corresponding recent snapshots. Policy replacement
invalidates contexts at owner dispatch as well as on the network worker, including
commands already queued when revocation occurs. Disconnect cancels matching pending
engine and structural work without stopping local source processing or recording.

The server admits at most 16 concurrent authenticated or handshaking sessions.
This finite deployment budget accommodates six independently scoped control clients,
one Brain duplex worker, one source-clock FX/analysis worker, and eight observer or
reconnect-overlap slots. The previous four-slot budget could not admit even the
three separate operator-monitor, talkback-destination and talkback-FOH controllers
alongside both workers. This is a reviewed resource limit, not an input-channel,
monitor-bus or universal product capacity. A seventeenth connection is refused
without evicting existing sessions; dropping a session returns its permit.

Per session, QUIC permits one bidirectional control stream and no unidirectional
streams, bounds receive/send windows to 65540 bytes and each datagram direction
to 256 × 1232 bytes. Authority handoff reserves 16 commands, 128 completions,
256 legacy media slots per direction and 64 Brain media slots per direction.
Thus the 16-session budget bounds aggregate queue slots to 256 commands,
2048 completions, 8192 legacy-media slots and 2048 Brain-media slots. Queue entries
have separately bounded payloads; these counts are not a claim of total process
RSS. Large control snapshot assembly retains its separate 1 MiB limit. Existing
authority read-state and Brain negotiation admission use the same session budget.
Memory, source-owner mailbox service time and reconnect isolation require validation
when raising this limit; permissions, leases, freshness and media ownership remain
independent of connection admission.

`authority_channel` connects a network session to the source/control owner through
bounded SPSC queues. `AuthorityMailbox::service` runs outside render before the next
source block. `HostAuthority` wraps the same `LocalAudio` used by local providers;
there is no second mixer or authority. Network workers never own the audio clock.
Generation changes drain completed replies, retire queued intent and require a new
connection and explicit grants. No command is automatically replayed.

Control frames use a four-byte big-endian length followed by strict JSON, at most
65536 bytes. Large replies use the existing GP14 snapshot-page protocol with a
1 MiB assembly bound. Duplicate keys and depth checks apply after reassembly too.
GP-REMOTE version 1 wraps the provider's exact C-AUDIO, GP07-processing, GP05-modules
and GP14-structure contracts; unsupported versions are refused. Legacy contracts
remain explicit and cannot truncate a dynamic provider into a legacy shape.

Media negotiation binds the fresh TLS-exporter session, source epoch, capability
and map generations, stable channel IDs, roles, encoding and source-frame delay.
GPA1 datagrams are protected by QUIC. Groups fit the negotiated QUIC datagram size;
there are at most 64 groups and 256 selected channels per role. These are bounded
transport resources, not a product channel ceiling. Analysis is exact PCM24, FX
send/return is float32. The composed host advertises 48-frame blocks; the standalone
transport also supports 96. Replayed, wrong-direction, stale-generation and late
wet packets cannot advance the source clock or enter a replacement source epoch.

The host taps admitted raw capture slots for analysis and actual pre-wet FOH buses
for FX. `BrainWorker` assembles source-frame groups and calls the owning FX library
through `host::BrainFx`; wet return enters the existing graph before PA. Its 960-frame
intentional FX delay is separate from negotiated network return delay. Missing wet
fades through `WetGate` while local dry processing and REC continue. Source recovery
clears previous media and fade history and requires explicit output rearm.

With `hardware-host`, `gigpies-remote --config PRIVATE.json` defaults to bounded,
device-free provider and Brain FX modes for functional acceptance. The synthetic
provider duration is at most60 seconds and its source runs independently of clients.
An explicitly configured physical provider additionally requires
`--activate-physical`; it advances the same authority from captured device frames
and reserves a durable source epoch. See [executable device composition](BRAIN_AUDIO.md#executable-device-composition)
for physical configuration, the separately bounded24-hour mode and source-agnostic FX.
Optional `record_take` starts the real REC owner, immediately releases its initial
FOH grant, and finalizes an explicitly incomplete take at source end. Initial
outputs remain safe until a client explicitly rearms them. Reports include exact
analysis sample comparisons, per-channel counts, packet hashes, wet acceptance and
source-frame evidence. These runs do not establish physical synchronization or
realtime hardware qualification.

After source/network quiescence, a requested recording gets a five-second absolute
monotonic observation deadline. Nonblocking lifecycle/status polls and asynchronous
sleeps (at most 5 ms, capped by remaining time) wait for the requested take's actual
terminal status. Preparing, pending, unknown, missing or malformed status cannot
produce success. Timeout or observation/terminal errors set the report fault used
by the CLI's nonzero exit, retaining the last observed status and any prior fault.
Expected source-end `incomplete` with host fault 6 remains allowed; no durable
counter or complete outcome is fabricated. Drain, fsync and publication remain in
the owning worker. This budget does not bound filesystem operations, report saving,
owner Drop (which may still join off the control path), or total process lifetime;
the external hard process deadline remains authoritative.

For bounded software diagnostics, a provider configuration may explicitly set
`"provider_timing": true`. It defaults to false and is rejected for physical
providers or durations above 60 seconds. The trace preallocates 139,264 numeric
64-byte slots (79,264 control and 60,000 source records, about 8.5 MiB), records
outside sample loops, and writes `provider_timing` in the final report. Final
report materialization needs additional temporary allocations. Disabled mode skips
trace storage, timestamps and statistics reads, while retaining fixed token
metadata in the existing bounded control queues. The enabled trace records
explicit session/request identities, control queue/dispatch/serialization/write
stages, connection-wide QUIC counters and aggregate source-tick costs. Deferred
completions have ordinal zero and retain their available request ID; they are
not attributed to a guessed request by queue order.

Trace timestamps use one process-local monotonic clock. Stage durations include
scheduling and preemption; they are neither CPU time nor one-way network latency.
Local write completion does not prove remote receipt. QUIC counters are aggregate
corroboration, not proof of a particular stream's stall cause. Capacity overflow,
incomplete records and remaining active tasks are explicit: a full trace may
truncate late-run control evidence, and shutdown's bounded 100 ms wait does not
prove complete teardown when `active_tasks` remains nonzero. The reported append
cost excludes failed-capacity attempts, token extraction, statistics reads and
timestamp-call overhead; per-event microsecond truncation also applies.
Desk's corresponding opt-in diagnostics are documented in its native frontend
contract. Instrumentation perturbs timing, and the partial append-cost measurement
is not its total overhead. These diagnostics do not relax authority or timing
requirements.

Focused normal tests: `cargo +1.97.1 test --locked --features hardware-host --lib remote::tests`.
Actual owner REC evidence is opt-in with `GP05_MANIFEST` set to an accepted manifest:

## Brain duplex audio extension

[Brain audio](BRAIN_AUDIO.md) adds GP15-brain control, GP15-device configuration
relay and GP15-media negotiation over the same authority and mutual-TLS protocol.
The separate duplex owner carries GBA1 talkback and operator-monitor packets in
independent bounded queues; the existing source-clock FX/analysis owner remains
admitted. FX permission does not authorize talkback. Each crossing uses the
[bounded ASRC bridge](BRAIN_AUDIO_BRIDGE.md), with both device epochs and map
identities. The Stagebox source clock remains the processing reference; Brain's
local duplex card has its own clock. This extension is undergoing integrated
software acceptance; it does not confer physical qualification.

Monitor packet identity follows selection generation; talkback identity follows
held-action generation. An unrelated PTT change therefore preserves monitor
continuity, including already queued monitor packets. Queue preservation requires
an unchanged authenticated owner/session, both device epochs/maps, monitor
selection, format and enabled monitor role; talkback bridge replacement is independent.
A newly negotiated monitor identity or disabling the role discards those queued samples.
At a source selection/disarm change before renegotiation, a still-live authenticated
duplex owner instead receives a bounded silent retirement of its old monitor identity.
The authority rewrites only queued monitor sample payloads to exact zero, preserving
headers, source indices and order, then emits zero samples for each actual 48-frame
source block. It never sends the new selected tap under the old identity. Retirement
ends at the first of 250 monotonic milliseconds or 12,000 source frames from the
first changed-selection block; repeated changes or old negotiation retries cannot
extend it. Missing/revoked owner permission, stale (over 250 ms) or faulted/disarmed
device observation, or changed source/device epoch or map closes the stream.
New negotiation retains the existing invalidation, fresh prefill and explicit rearm
requirements. Packets already transferred to the proxy/network and samples already
submitted to a device cannot be withdrawn; this is not an atomic cross-node mute
claim. ASRC counters, timeline checks and acceptance thresholds are unchanged.
Control negotiation still has its own monotonically increasing
acceptance generation. Device replacement requires a matching epoch/map observation
acknowledgment, closed readback, and a subsequent explicit arm revision. No stored
intent or queued pre-replacement snapshot can authorize playback.

`capture_queue_dropped` is an unsigned count of48-frame microphone blocks refused
by the bounded capture queue since the duplex process started. The runtime and producer fixtures share its telemetry
encoder; consumers validate it explicitly alongside the other device counters.

All wire telemetry uses the existing strict integer JSON grammar: amplitude in
nano units, output/input ratio in parts per billion, signed estimated skew in
parts per billion, nominal queue/filter latency in microseconds, and nullable
physical-mapping uncertainty in milliframes. These are neither measured one-way
network latency nor proof of hardware clock lock. Producer fixtures live under
`tests/fixtures/brain-v1` and `tests/fixtures/brain-device-v1`.

## GP15-held-proof:1 additive controller read

HostAuthority implements a strict standalone proof envelope (8192 encoded bytes),
restricted to authenticated TalkbackDestinations with an exact live writer lease.
The request echoes attachment generations and a reviewed configuration digest;
its positive query_id is separate from mutation request IDs. Successful query IDs
increase per authenticated session, with at most MAX_CONNECTIONS tracking entries,
removed on disconnect. Refusals do not advance the accepted query ID or freshness.
No transport framing, QUIC window, task topology or mutation deadline changes.

The reply context is the entire exact request. A proof contains one committed
revision/source frame and a fixed scalar witness; a refusal has no witness and
one of identity, permission, scope, lease, clock, query_id, config_changed or
capacity. Malformed/unsupported envelopes use existing outer transport refusal.
All authentication, independent FOH permission and render-boundary mutation checks
remain authoritative. A compact proof cannot replace full raw UI/configuration
readback or authorize a grant. See [Brain control](BRAIN_AUDIO_CONTROL.md#compact-held-proof-gp15-held-proof1)
for digest/lifecycle boundaries and producer fixture generation. Implementation
is not final combined-network or physical acceptance.


## Atomic controller operations

The composed `HostAuthority` adds `GP15-lease-maintenance:1` and
`GP15-paired-readback:1` over the existing authenticated control stream and paging.
Their requests bind the current TLS session-derived writer, show/source epoch and
capability/map generations. No payload identity creates authentication. Current
policy and exact scoped live lease are rechecked before replaying maintenance;
read-only paired observation requires no write grant.

Maintenance accepts all canonical existing C-AUDIO scopes: FOH, named monitors
1/2, dynamic `{"monitor": N}` for u16 N >= 3, PA configuration, output routes and
the three Brain scopes. The live lease must already match configured topology
and the exact requested scope; current `scope_permission` authorization applies
before every retry. Malformed/unknown scope forms and noncanonical monitor aliases
never maintain a lease. No monitor cap or new grant is introduced.

Maintenance is serialized with the existing owner. It only extends an admitted
existing lease, without a revision compare or revision increment. Replay lookup
precedes refusal of new work while any ordinary/processing/external transaction
is staged. Its per-live-lease 64-entry history follows current authority clones;
retries do not renew twice or outlive lease revocation. It never updates raw,
Brain or held-read freshness. Legacy C-AUDIO revision comparison remains unchanged.
The added scopes use atomic maintenance in explicitly requested GP15 paired mode,
not merely because an attachment has QUIC/held identity. Both passive and
pre-command renewal use that mode consistently; a failed GP15 attempt cannot
select legacy fallback. Non-GP15 renewal remains unchanged. Older providers may
refuse added scopes and clients must expose the refusal without regranting.

Paired observation captures committed raw and Brain state synchronously and
checks common revision/frame before encoding the whole response within 1 MiB.
Admission also accounts for the existing GP-REMOTE Reply wrapper inside that same
transport assembly limit; no extra topology clone is needed to size its overhead.
Raw and Brain read latches are admitted together only after successful construction;
the independent processing-read timestamp is neither replaced nor refreshed.
A separate monotonically increasing nonce map has at most `MAX_CONNECTIONS`
entries and clears on disconnect. No large response cache is kept. Maintenance
is bounded to 8192 bytes per request/reply. Existing frame/page/queue bounds stay
unchanged. Unsupported versions fail closed through the existing outer refusal.

Focused producer validation (under the shared build lock, nonincremental, one job):
`cargo +1.97.1 test --locked -j1 --features hardware-host --lib atomic` and
`cargo +1.97.1 test --locked -j1 --test atomic_control`.
These tests are normal production regressions. Full integration suites and network
acceptance remain the coordinator's subsequent combined-source gates. See
[Brain control](BRAIN_AUDIO_CONTROL.md#atomic-lease-maintenance-and-paired-readback)
for consumer deadline and held-proof separation requirements.
