# Status and next steps

## v0.1.0 — first public foundation

Implemented:

- Standalone Rust library and CLI; pinned toolchain and locked dependencies.
- Read-only WAV header inventory for a file or a flat directory, with JSON output.
- Synthetic regression tests and Linux CI; no hardware required.
- Architecture, source-material notes, dependency map and preserved concept sources.

## First offline automixer — implemented, offline-validated

- Synchronized native-rate streaming soundcheck with bounded activity-aware trim,
  linked calibration groups, causal history and explicit freeze/save.
- Editable role presets: HPF, parametric EQ, stereo-linked compression, pan/faders.
- BWF time-reference alignment, zero-padded tails and conservative master peak control.
- Frozen-settings rendering, full-song local A/B WAVs and loudness-matched copies.
- Measurements and gain/reduction histories; input clipping is reported, not repaired.
- Synthetic DSP/routing/persistence tests; opt-in deterministic private-media variations.

The first full-band experiment has been rendered and its file/measurement contracts
checked. Listening is the next evaluation; tests do not establish musical quality.
See [workflow, presets and limitations](AUTOMIX.md).

Not implemented: live audio or device transport, networking, web/TUI/controller,
recording, lighting integration, gates or true-peak limiting.
No live latency, acoustic safety, listening acceptance or Pi headroom is claimed.

Next: audition the unmatched OLD/A/B musical-balance candidates and record listener
preference separately from policy compliance. A second source session and hardware
integration follow when useful.

The [archived blueprint](archive/blueprints/blueprint-v2.md) retains the wider scope.

## Optional effects and automatic review pass

Implemented: separate plate/chamber/hall reverbs, vocal predelay validation, chorus,
filtered delay, oversampled excitation and modest master maximization. The Rust
`finish` command analyzes the preliminary mix, applies bounded spectral/return/dynamics
rules, rerenders and records its decisions and post-checks. Corrections are made by
code; no spectrogram interpretation or AI decision is in that loop.
[Commands, algorithms and limitations](FX_PASS.md). Listening acceptance remains pending.

## Unity-source revision

Implemented and offline-validated: DI-only bass, unity input trims and faders,
90 Hz channel HPFs except kick/bass, 40 Hz processed master HPF, measured compressor
thresholds and loss compensation, independent final PCM output leveling to −0.01 dBFS, preserved
float sums, and code-generated envelope/spectral reports. No loudness matching in
this workflow. [Commands and limits](UNITY_PASS.md). Listening acceptance remains open.

## Musical balance pass

Implemented and offline-validated: synchronized role-band and event measurements,
explicit tom-bleed uncertainty, microphone covariance, bounded static kit/group
fader search, held-out section regression checks, event-level compressor/master
reduction, and exact unmatched OLD/A/B excerpts. The local processing candidate
partially restores guitar low-mid cuts after rendering the fader-only candidate.
Initial policy targets remain hypotheses and some remain unmet; listener preference
is pending. No playback or hardware changes. [Workflow and limits](BALANCE_PASS.md).
