# Offline musical balance

Measure an ensemble and optionally propose bounded fader changes from an explicit musical policy. Without a policy, preserve faders and report observations. See [source preservation](SOURCE_PRESERVATION.md).

## Commands

Use a new directory for every run. The baseline must already have DI-only bass,
unity input trims, explicit channel/master HPF settings (including bypass),
`output_mode: "unmatched"`, and a −0.01 dBFS ceiling. Incompatible settings are
rejected, not silently converted. Pan, BWF timing, stereo linking, compression,
EQ, FX and master settings are preserved by the fader pass.

```sh
cargo build --locked --release
# Measure without rendering or changing settings:
target/release/gigpies balance-analyze baseline-settings.json source-dir new-analysis-dir
# With an explicit reviewed musical policy, search and measure a fader proposal:
target/release/gigpies balance-pass baseline-settings.json source-dir new-pass-dir policy.json
# Without a policy, both commands observe and preserve faders; no taste targets.
```

`A-settings.json` is the frozen fader candidate. The `A/` directory contains the
full render, independent export gain, channel/master histories and bus/FX meters.
`optimization.json` records evaluations, proposed fit/held-out results and acceptance.
Rejected proposals produce unchanged faders; their proposed metrics remain available
for diagnosis. `status.json` separately records technical completion, whether all
measurable policy targets were met, and an unset listener-preference field.
`decisions.json` records old/new faders and evidence references.

After rendering A, inspect its evidence before editing a copy as `B-settings.json`.
Log each processing edit's old/new value, evidence and tradeoff. Keep all settings
editable and avoid adding compressor compensation a second time. Render B with
`render`, then remeasure with `balance-analyze` and the same policy. A processing
hypothesis can be rejected without changing A. Neither command adds master notches,
channel normalization, matched listening copies, time alignment or polarity flips.

## Measurements and confidence

Analysis runs the production channel strips, excitation, fader/pan routing, FX and
master processing at native rate. Each 20 ms window records:

- Per-channel input and pre/post-compressor RMS in dBFS, peak, instantaneous mean/max
  gain reduction in dB, stereo correlation, activity, confidence and event flags.
- Routed stereo covariance for broadband and approximate 40–120, 120–500, 500–1500
  and 1500–5000 Hz bands. Band filters subtract adjacent second-order Butterworth
  HPF outputs; they overlap and are not rectangular FFT bands. Group energies include
  covariance cross terms, so correlated microphone cancellation is retained.
- Separate close drums, overheads, drum room, bass, guitars, direct vocal, vocal room
  and summed generated-return energies in `groups.csv`. Excitation is included in
  each source; its separate residual meter and per-return totals are in the renderer's
  `measurements.json`. The analysis covers the source timeline; render meters also
  cover the configured FX tail.
- Master mean/max reduction and pre-export RMS in `master.csv`.

Activity requires post-EQ/pre-compressor RMS above −75 dBFS and within 30 dB of
that source's p95 window. Confidence is an explicit heuristic score, **not a calibrated
probability**: 0.85 for activity separated from the source's p10 by 6 dB, or sustained
activity with p10 at least 3 dB above the absolute floor; otherwise 0.55. Rejected
activity has zero confidence; ambiguous tom bleed is capped at 0.35. The default
search requires 0.65. Very quiet playing below the floor remains unresolved; the
floor and relative margin are editable. These rules do not identify words or notes.

Drum events require a 5 dB rise over the preceding 60 ms and 120 ms between triggers.
The event anchor is the strongest role-band window in the following 60 ms, with
20 ms resolution. Kick uses the low band; snare/toms use the body band. Reported
attack/body/decay windows are 0–20, 20–80 and 80–240 ms from that anchor. Thus the
attack measurement describes the early peak region, not a sample-exact acoustic
onset. Phrase-activity starts use 0–100, 100–300 and 300–600 ms envelopes.
Adjacent events can overlap the decay; inspect `events.json` and `windows.csv`.

Tom bleed rejection explicitly compares coincident kick/snare events (±20 ms).
With at least three reference events, it estimates a median tom/reference band-energy
ratio. A coincident tom candidate within 6 dB of that reference is marked ambiguous.
Only accepted tom events and their next 240 ms qualify as active tom playing.
This can reject genuine unison hits and miss delayed/independent bleed. It neither
separates sources nor estimates a clean tom waveform. `microphone-relationships.json`
reports simultaneous correlation, event ratios and actual summed power versus
incoherent power for related drum and vocal microphones. Negative sum differences
flag possible cancellation, not a proven phase defect. No automatic correction follows.

Active-source summaries describe each source; **they are not cross-instrument fader
targets**. Ratios used for optimization always use identical windows on both sides.
In particular, an intermittent tom's whole-song RMS is never compared to a continuous
guitar to choose its fader.

## Listening evidence

Each finished PCM file is independently finalized from its own sample peak to
−0.01 dBFS by the existing exporter. No raw-reference gain or LUFS target is used.
Float sums can exceed full scale without clipping. This is **sample-peak** protection;
no true-peak claim is made. Keep the baseline and previous renders intact.

```sh
python3 scripts/balance_excerpts.py OLD.wav A.wav B.wav new-excerpts-dir 12 36 72
```

This optional standard-library script checks matching formats/frame counts and the
finished sample peaks, then copies exact 12-second PCM slices. It writes a manifest
with full paths, hashes, frame positions and explicit **OLD → A → B** order at each
start. Excerpts retain their full-song gain; they are not individually normalized.
The script verifies the copied PCM bytes and never plays audio.

For the local experiment, settings, analysis, processing decisions and full-song
A/B renders are under `artifacts/automix/musical-balance-v2/`. Private state and media
stay ignored. The local `evidence/` report records measured outcomes and unresolved
conflicts; it is not a listening verdict. Listen for kit impact versus cymbal/room
level, tom fills, guitar weight during singing, vocal-room prominence and FX tails.

## Research applicability

Reviewed 2026-10-01:

- [Moffat and Sandler, AES 20355](https://aes.org/publications/elibrary-page/?id=20355):
  the accessible abstract identifies interference between live drum microphones as
  a problem for treating each track as an independent source. Its proposed equal
  perceptual loudness objective is explicitly outside this experiment's requirements.
  We inspected the abstract, not a subscriber-only full paper; no source-separation
  implementation or numerical target is attributed to it.
- [Ronan et al., arXiv:1803.09960](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09960): the current version
  is withdrawn, with an intellectual-property ownership note. Its abstract discusses
  a psychoacoustically inspired masking metric and subgrouping. Our ratio proxy does
  not implement that model, reproduce its results or inherit its validation.
- [De Man, PhD thesis](https://www.brechtdeman.com/publications/pdf/PhD-thesis.pdf):
  the retrievable indexed perceptual-evaluation section compares automatic and human
  mixes using listening tests. Full-PDF retrieval failed in this session; applicability
  is limited to that section. It supports keeping perceptual evaluation separate from
  technical measurements, not the numerical ranges above. The normalized-input
  comparison described there is not used here.

## Validation

`cargo test --locked --test balance` covers known buried-hit and excessive-room
faults, vocal/guitar competition, no-change, silence, low confidence, quiet playing,
coincident bleed, stereo/phase relationships, global-gain invariance, bounded and
repeatable search, held-out veto and evidence non-overwrite. Synthetic audio checks
activity and routing independently of the optimizer's objective. The full normal
production suite also covers BWF routing, linked DSP, FX, persistence and export.

Private full-song renders and excerpt verification are explicit opt-in preparation,
not normal CI tests. Historical source-variation and older audition tests remain
ignored unless their own protected behavior changes. No playback, host-audio change,
hardware verification or listener preference follows from passing these tests.

## SOURCE and paired ensemble review

The [Complainiacs reassessment](../archive/studies/COMPLAINIACS_REASSESSMENT.md) adds
`balance-source-analyze INITIAL_SOURCE.json SOURCES NEW_DIRECTORY` and the
`scripts/ensemble_review.py` observer. SOURCE bypasses all DSP while retaining the
supplied initial pan/faders. Processed measurement and optimizer behavior remain.
Group CSVs add coherent `drums` and `vocal_sum` groups and an
`incoherent_broadband_dbfs` column; existing fields retain their values.

The paired report fixes activity to explicit SOURCE evidence with training-only
thresholds, checks identical raw windows/routing, and retains section and raw
quiet/strong strata. Export gain is separate from pre-master group energy. It never
turns a relationship into a preferred target or a listener verdict. Existing
optimizer failures remain failures even when a separately documented artistic
selection follows revised listener direction. See the reassessment for that
choice, its remaining room-ratio failures and the bounded rejected EQ probes.

Group CSVs also expose `snare`, `kick`, `toms`, `drum_ambience`,
`drums_without_snare`, `ensemble` and `ensemble_without_snare`. Both ensemble groups
include generated FX. Coherent sums retain signed microphone interaction; the
power of the sum need not equal the sum of separate powers. These are mixtures,
not separated snare or bleed estimates. All groups are before master/export.

`scripts/snare_context.py SPEC.json training|held_out NEW_REPORT.json` summarizes
fixed baseline events in these groups. SPEC supplies `rate`, `source_analysis`,
`diagnosis` and `variants` with `id`/`analysis`. It requires explicit SOURCE bypass
evidence, unchanged raw inputs and complete event windows; training determines
quiet/strong and vocal-activity thresholds. Reports retain section, rapid/compound
contexts, signed interaction and insufficient counts without selecting settings.

## Historical evidence

The [dated study and original results](../archive/studies/BALANCE_PASS.md) retain experiment-specific settings and validation history.
