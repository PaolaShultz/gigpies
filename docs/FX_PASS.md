# Offline effects and automatic review pass

For the current DI-only comparison with unity source gains, 90/40 Hz low cuts and
**no loudness matching**, use [UNITY_PASS.md](UNITY_PASS.md). The settings and
matching commands below describe the earlier experiments.


This extends the first mix with optional effects and a **code-driven** final review.
The Rust CLI renders a preliminary mix, measures it, applies deterministic bounded
corrections, renders a new mix and measures that result. Neither a visual judgement
of a spectrogram nor an AI-selected frequency is part of the correction loop.
The rules are an experimental heuristic, not a claim to recognize musical defects.

## Commands

Old settings still render with effects disabled. New destinations are required and
previous settings/audio are never overwritten. These commands use local ignored files:

```sh
cargo build --locked --release
target/release/gigpies fx-preset artifacts/automix/show/prepared.json \
  artifacts/automix/fx-pass/settings-auto.json
target/release/gigpies finish artifacts/automix/fx-pass/settings-auto.json \
  recordings/sessions/complainiacs-etc artifacts/automix/fx-pass/automatic-final
target/release/gigpies compare artifacts/automix/show/processed.wav \
  artifacts/automix/fx-pass/automatic-final/final/processed.wav \
  artifacts/automix/fx-pass/compare-with-first
```

Use fresh paths when repeating. `fx-preset` preserves the prepared trims, original
channel EQ/compressors and routing, and adds an editable effects rack. `render` applies
settings exactly; `finish` performs the automatic review. An optional fifth argument
to `finish` supplies an edited policy JSON copied from a previous run's
`review-policy.json`. Policy values are validated; correction limits cannot be
raised beyond the conservative implementation bounds.

`finish` writes:

- `before-review/`: preliminary FX mix and all normal render measurements/history.
- `review-policy.json`: thresholds and correction budgets used for this run.
- `spectral-before.json`: actual measured mix band energies and temporal statistics.
- `decisions.json`: each changed parameter, old/new values and measured reason.
- `reviewed-settings.json`: complete settings after code decisions.
- `final/`: the new render, frozen settings, measurements and histories.
- `spectral-after.json`, `review-result.json`: post-correction measurements,
  remaining spectral candidates and whether the reduction budget was met.
- `review-comparison/`: before/after **automatic review**, matched at −23 LUFS.

`compare` instead compares the **previous pass to the complete new pass**. It writes
`previous-matched.wav`, `new-matched.wav` and a report with remeasured quantized-file
loudness, peaks and padding. It matches at −23 LUFS or lower if either file needs more
sample-peak headroom. It applies static gain only; a shorter file receives zero tail
padding. It does not adjust starts, mix balance or dynamics.

The new render adds four seconds for effect decay. Source sample zero is unchanged.
Both base A/B files and their listening copies have the same extended length. The
comparison with the first pass pads that older recording to this length.

## Signal path and engines

Channel strip → subtle excitation → fader/pan → dry sum plus post-fader FX sends →
wet returns → master gain → optional corrective master EQ → modest maximizer →
existing final sample-peak protection.

Every bus has its own engine state, send levels, wet return, HPF and low-pass filter.
No dry path is added by an effect engine. Original room microphones are retained.
These are algorithmic plate/hall/chamber treatments adapted from SHR FX, not measured
impulse responses or physical plate emulations. Plate uses denser input/output
allpass diffusion and shorter comb lengths than the hall. Decay/damping parameters
are unitless engine controls, **not seconds of RT60**.

| Bus | Initial settings | Intended wet/source RMS after review |
|---|---|---:|
| Snare plate | 12 ms predelay, decay .68, damping .40, 180 Hz HPF / 6.5 kHz LPF | −20 dB |
| Tom chamber | 18 ms predelay, decay .58, damping .55, 140 Hz / 5.5 kHz | −22 dB |
| Vocal hall | **45 ms predelay**, decay .52, damping .62, 200 Hz / 6 kHz | −24 dB |
| Vocal plate | **40 ms predelay**, decay .46, damping .55, 250 Hz / 5.5 kHz | −30 dB |
| Vocal chorus | 17 ms base, ±1.2 ms modulation, .35 Hz, stereo phase spread, 180 Hz / 7 kHz | −23 dB |
| Vocal delay | 258.62 / 344.83 ms L/R, feedback .18, damping .60, 250 Hz / 4.5 kHz | −21 dB |

The delay times approximate a dotted eighth and quarter at the source notice's 174 BPM.
Vocal reverb predelay is validated at **30 ms minimum**, including the separate vocal
plate. Sharing the snare's short-predelay bus with the vocal would fail validation.
Tom sends retain their panning. Chorus and delay are restrained parallel layers.

All channels receive a filtered nonlinear harmonic residual: 2.5 kHz tuning, drive .25,
tone .35, warm mode, residual amount .25. The SHR FX engine oversamples the nonlinearity
4× with two half-band FIR stages, filters the return and removes DC. The dry signal
is not delayed or distorted; the small harmonic residual has the engine's FIR latency.
The residual meter makes the actual contribution visible; low-level signals generate
very little additional energy. This is intentionally subtle, not an automatic treble boost.

Maximization applies 2.5 dB drive into a linked sample limiter at −12.5 dBFS in the
internal bus, with 120 ms release. The threshold is low because the calibrated mix
has substantial headroom. A later constant listening gain targets −20.5 LUFS,
subject to the −2 dBFS sample ceiling, giving a few dB more listening level than the
first pass's −23 LUFS target. Both the drive and the actual gain reduction are reported;
adding gain alone is not evidence of maximization. Neither limiter measures true peaks.
Use the −23 LUFS comparison to judge whether the altered dynamics are useful.

## What the code decides

`src/automix/analysis.rs` contains the analysis and policy; it uses no Python, plotting
package, remote model or network service.

1. Read the **rendered stereo mix** at native rate. Analyze 8192-sample Hann windows
   with 50% overlap using a radix-2 FFT. Sum channel powers, not summed-channel samples,
   so cancellation cannot hide energy. Integrate 25 third-octave bands (31.25 Hz–8 kHz).
2. Exclude analysis windows below −60 dBFS RMS. Require at least eight seconds of
   active hop durations before making spectral corrections.
3. A candidate must have at least 4 dB prominence relative to the geometric mean of
   adjacent band powers, carry at least 4% of covered-band power, recur in at least
   40% of active windows, and occur in at least four of ten timeline segments.
   This rejects isolated transients and broadly smooth spectra in the regression tests.
4. Only low-mid buildup (140–500 Hz) and presence/harshness (2–6.3 kHz) ranges are
   eligible. Protect sub/bass fundamentals and the intermediate region from this
   simple heuristic. Rank eligible bands by prominence; add at most two Q=1.4 bell
   cuts. Cut size is `min(1.5, 0.5 + 0.5 * (prominence - 4))` dB under the default
   policy. Never boost, remove existing EQ or stack a cut near existing corrective EQ.
5. If measured maximizer reduction exceeds 3 dB, lower drive by the excess, down to
   zero. This backs off excessive dynamic control rather than adding compression to
   satisfy a spectral target. Channel compressors retain their role presets.
6. Measure each wet return against the post-fader source sum feeding that bus. Adjust
   its return toward the configured wet/source target, capped at ±12 dB for this pass
   and −60…+18 dB absolute. Ignore silent/insufficient return energy. This compensates
   different engine transfer gains without independently normalizing source microphones.
7. Render again and record the result. Residual prominence is allowed; the algorithm
   does not loop until the spectrum is flat. `within_reduction_budget: false` requires
   review, not a success claim. Listening remains necessary even when it is true.

A repeated musical note can meet these criteria. Persistence is evidence for a small
candidate correction, not proof of an unwanted resonance. The low cut limit and
single-pass design limit damage from that ambiguity. No aesthetic conclusion or
“better mix” verdict is generated. This whole-program review is deliberately offline;
it does not feed future information into the causal soundcheck or claim live operation.

## Optional plots

`scripts/analyze_mix.py` is an optional measurement/plotting aid only. Its plots and
local peak list never feed `finish` or determine EQ. Red/pink colors mean energy on
a fixed shared scale, not defects. For equal-level plots, use the files from `compare`:

```sh
python3 -m venv artifacts/analysis-venv
artifacts/analysis-venv/bin/pip install -r scripts/analysis-requirements.txt
artifacts/analysis-venv/bin/python scripts/analyze_mix.py \
  artifacts/automix/fx-pass/final-plots \
  artifacts/automix/fx-pass/compare-with-first/previous-matched.wav \
  artifacts/automix/fx-pass/compare-with-first/new-matched.wav
```

The PNG/PDF and JSON stay local. The Rust application builds without those packages.

## Validation and listening

The default synthetic suite tests vocal predelay enforcement, impulse decay, distinct
reverb outputs, wet-only behavior, repeatability, silent input, linked maximizer bounds,
oversampled exciter harmonics/alias suppression, legacy settings, automated correction
of persistent buildup, rejection of transients/noise/silence, bounded return/dynamic
adjustments and the complete finish/save/compare workflow.

The private full-song pass is an explicit local experiment, not a default CI test.
Old unrelated source-variation auditions are not repeated for this effects change.
No playback or host configuration change occurs. Listen for vocal intelligibility,
chorus detuning, delayed-word clutter, snare plate ringing, tom wash, sibilance and
whether the small maximizer reduction preserves the drum attack.
